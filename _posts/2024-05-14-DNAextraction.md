PureGene Genomic DNA Extraction (Single Fly)



Protocol – ​
1. ​To perform cell lysis, first chill the cell lysis solution until it becomes cloudy and place 1.7 ml tubes containing flies on ice. 
2. Add 100 μl of the cell lysis solution to each tube and homogenize each fly for 2-4 seconds using a motor-driven pestle. 
3. Incubate the samples at 65°C for 15 minutes, then cool to room temperature. 

4. For RNase treatment, add 2 μl of a 1/4 dilution of RNase A (4 mg/mL) to the homogenate and mix by inverting the tubes 25 times. If using the more concentrated RNase A (100 mg/mL), adjust the volume accordingly. 
5. Incubate at 37°C for 40 minutes, then cool to room temperature. 

6. For protein precipitation, add 33 μl of protein precipitation solution to the RNase-treated lysate and vortex at high speed for 10 seconds. Place the sample on ice for 5 minutes and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 minutes. 
7. For DNA precipitation, transfer the supernatant to a new 1.7 ml tube containing 100 μl of isopropanol and mix by inverting the tube gently 50 times. 
8. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant. 
9. Add 100 μl of freshly-prepared 70% ethanol to wash the pellet, invert the tube gently a few times, and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 1 minute. 
10. Discard the supernatant and invert the tube on a Kimwipe, allowing it to air dry for 45 minutes. 
11. Finally, for DNA resuspension, add 20 μl of DNA Hydration Solution and let the DNA resuspend overnight at room temperature. 




**Notes/Calculations** – RNase A kept together, used only when needed. This protocol requires the PureGene Cell Core Kit. 
14 samples + 1 extra = 15 x 2 = 30ul 
Stock Soln of RNase A = 20 mg/mL
20 x V1 = 4 x 30 ul, V1 = 6 ul, 30 - 6 = 24 ul Molecular Grade H2O
